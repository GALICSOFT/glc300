Licensing

What licensing applies to the Ogg Vorbis format?
		The Ogg Vorbis specification is in the public domain. It is completely free for commercial or noncommercial use.
		That means that commercial developers may independently write Ogg Vorbis software which is compatible with the specification for no charge
			and without restrictions of any kind.
		However, the software packages we have developed are available under various free/open-source software licenses with varying allowances and restrictions.

What licensing applies to the included Ogg Vorbis software?
	Most (but not all) of our utility software is released under the terms of the GNU GPL.
	The libraries and SDKs are released under our BSD-like license.
	Note that developers are still free to use the specification to write implementations of Ogg Vorbis licensed under other terms.

We make commercial, closed source software. Can I use Ogg Vorbis at all? What licensing do I need to pay?
	Again, there are no licensing fees for ANY use of the Ogg Vorbis specification.
	As a commercial developer, you are free to create and sell (or give away) open or closed source implementations of Vorbis encoders, decoders, or other tools.
	However, if you use our software rather than writing an independent implementation, you must respect the terms of the license.
	Our libraries are available under our BSD-like license and can be used whole or in part by closed source applications.

Are there licensing fees for distributing, selling, or streaming media in the Ogg Vorbis format?
	No.

If there aren't any licensing fees, how are you going to make money off the format? Will you charge fees later, after Vorbis becomes popular?
	The benefits of a patent-free, license-free format outweigh the concerns of making money directly from the format.
	The Vorbis format will always be free and in the public domain.
	Xiph.org is investigating a variety of models for funding development, some of which may include licensing non-free Vorbis-related programs and	libraries to commercial projects.
	Nevertheless, the reference encoder and decoder will always be open source and third parties will always be free to modify or reimplement them.
